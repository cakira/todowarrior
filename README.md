_Synchronize [Toodledo](https://www.toodledo.com/) and
[Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)_

## Why?
I've been using [Toodledo](https://www.toodledo.com/) for some years
(decades?) as my task list/to-do list manager, and I like it. I use it on
both my desktop, through the web interface, and on my smartphone, through
a third-party app.

However, as a software/firmware developer, I also like the quickness of
using the terminal to add and list my tasks/to-do list. Consequently,
[Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) is quite convenient, and I use it
to record some tasks.

The problem arises when I'm not at my computer and want to see the tasks
in Taskwarrior. I've already tried using the site
[Inthe.AM](https://inthe.am/) for that, but it seems I can't get used to
it.

So, I want to use Toodledo to see my Taskwarrior's tasks.
